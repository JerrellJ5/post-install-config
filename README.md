Configuring agents in osTicket involves setting up user accounts for support staff who will handle and respond to customer support tickets. This process includes assigning roles and permissions, such as ticket management and access to specific departments or features. Agents are configured through the osTicket admin panel, where you can define their user roles, contact details, and operational scope to streamline support workflows and ensure efficient ticket resolution.

Configuring the Service Level Agreement(SLA) in osTicket involves setting up rules and timeframes for how quickly support tickets should be addressed and resolved. This process ensures that tickets are handled in a timely manner according to predefined standards. You define SLA policies within the osTicket admin panel, specifying response and resolution times based on ticket priority or department, which helps maintain consistent and efficient support operations.

Configuring **Help Topics** in osTicket involves setting up categories that classify the types of support requests or issues submitted by users. This helps in organizing and routing tickets effectively. Within the osTicket admin panel, you can create and customize these topics to match your support needs, ensuring that tickets are directed to the appropriate departments or agents based on the help topic selected by the user. This setup improves ticket management and facilitates more efficient support workflows.
